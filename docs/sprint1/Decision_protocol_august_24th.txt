Decision protocol august 24th
The group met at V201
Jóhann, Hörður and Richard attended in person
Kristján had said that he was not able to attend in person
Daniel and Gylfi had not responded to the email that Richard sent with a discord invite
Hörður knows Daniel and said that he could not attend because he had a broken leg

The group decided on the system domain being a bowling alley because they felt that it was something everyone had some experience with
the resource would be bowling lanes and the customer would be the players

Richard forked the gitlab repo and set up issues for making user stories
The group decided that each member that attended this class would write at least 3 user stories to begin with

The group decided to make the system with Django and decided on a few programming rules

The meeting finished and it was decided that the group would stay in contact online and meet next week in the same class
